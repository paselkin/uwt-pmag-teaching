    "This document describes how to load and process paleomagnetic (AF demagnetization) data from the WWU cryogenic magnetometer using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and [iPmag](http://pmagpy.github.io/Example_PmagPy_Notebook.html). It assumes that you have [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/academic-subscriptions/) installed, since that allows you to use the Python programming language, and [PmagPy](http://pmagpy.github.io/) paleomagnetic tools. In this example, we will cover:\n",
    "* Loading data to memory from disk\n",
    "* Producing a Zijderveld vector-endpoint plot to show remanent magnetization directions\n",
    "* Producing a vector-difference-sum plot to show the decay of remanent magnetization during demagnetization\n",
    "* Calculating principal component directions following Kirschvink (1980)\n",
    "* Displaying data on an equal area diagram\n",
    "* Calculating site statistics\n",
